;What is Bouldering?;what-is-bouldering;Bouldering is a form of rock climbing that is performed on small rock formations or artificial rock walls, known as boulders, without the use of ropes or harnesses. It is a highly addictive sport that challenges your brain, and can improve your health!;;"Bouldering is very different from normal climbing: There is no harness and no rope to prevent you from falling, only a pad on the ground absorbs falling people — and that’s fine because routes are much shorter: normally between 3 and 4.5 meters. On the other hand, routes are also much more difficult: think of it as condensed problems that you want to solve, whereas climbing is more about endurance. 
In both cases, when you reach the top you will feel a rush of pride, positivity and euphoria — and that’s what makes you feel great and probably is one reason why this sport is so popular and addictive. The best way to get started and get familiar with bouldering is simply to do it.";;;
;Safety Rules;safety-rules;"It is important to understand the rules of your local climbing gym before you climb there. In addition to that, here are a few “common sense"" rules that will help you prevent dangerous situations.";;"Always pay attention to fellow climbers when walking around in the gym. Falling off the wall is an inherent part of bouldering. Walking, standing and sitting in the falling zone should be avoided.
Be considerate of other climbers; please no running or yelling.
Many boulder routes are overlapping which may lead to collisions. Make sure that your boulder is completely free before starting. 
Climbing is even more enjoyable if you are acting considerately. Try to be as friendly towards others as you would expect them to be!";;;
;Apple Watch App;apple-watch-app;iRedpoint includes a powerful Apple Watch app. Use it to track your climbing activity while you’re in the gym.;;"You can wear your Apple Watch while bouldering. Some people even like to connect AirPods to their watch and listen to their own music. It is not required to have your iPhone connected to your watch while climbing. The app was designed to run offline and to transfer your workout session to the iPhone app once the connection is re-estasblished.
Before you start climbing, start the iRedpoint App on your Apple Watch. Press the digital crown to go to your home screen and select iRedpoint. 
Then, press on “Start Bouldering”. During your bouldering session iRedpoint will provide the number of ascents, elapsed time, total climbed meters and heart rate. 
When finished with the session, swipe left and select “Finish Bouldering”. The Apple Watch will then process your workout data and send it to your iPhone. You can then see the detailed workout information in the iPhone app.";;;
;Apple Watch Advanced Settings;apple-watch-setup;To be able to see the latest stats and metrics on your watch while climbing, you should make sure that iRedpoint stays in the foreground during your workout sessions.;;"Open the ""Settings"" app on your Apple Watch.
Scroll down and go to “General"".
Select ""Wake Screen"" to show all available wake screen options.
Under ""On Screen Raise Show Last App"" find ""While in Session"". This allows you to see the latest statistics while in a climbing workout session. Otherwise, the watch could return to the watch face after a while.";;;https://www.apple.com/shop/browse/affiliate_program
;Important Terms;important-terms;Here is some important climbing terminology that will help you speak to fellow climbers at the gym about your recent ascents.;;"<b>Route</b>: A route is one defined ascent on a wall. Usually it consists of holds of one color. It has a start and a top. Each route requires different strength and can have different difficulties. While it defines which holds to use it does usually not define how to climb the route. There are always multiple approaches! Find the one that works best for you.
<b>Difficulty</b>: The difficulty of a route is used to compare and measure your climbing skills. When you come to a new gym and know your bouldering grade you immediately know which routes are easy and which ones are hard for you to climb. Different gyms use different codes to indicate difficulty. Many use a V-Scale (V0, V1, V2, …) others have color-coded holds. Ask in your gym which method they use!
<b>Chalk</b>: Chalk is the white powered that climbers put not heir hands to have better grip. It absorbs sweat from the skin and makes holds less slippery. Chalk is usually stored in so-called chalk-bags. Chalk is actually not the same chalk you know from school but rather magnesia (oxidized magnesium).
<b>Hold</b>: A hold is one hold in a route. It is usually colored and exists in plenty different forms and sizes.
<b>Volume</b>: Volumes are larger attachments to the wall that have the same surface like the wall. You can use them for every route. They are usually a good option for your feed.
<b>Send</b>: Send is the verb that you use when you successfully finished a route. You then say: “I sent the yellow route!”.
<b>Flash</b>: Flashing a route is something special. You say this when you send the route first try. Like a hole-in-one! “I flashed the blue route over there!”.
<b>Dynamic Climbing</b>: Dynamic climbing is the opposite of static climbing. It means that you reach to the next hold using a lot of momentum or even jump to it. This is why dynamic movements involve more risk but they are also fun! Some routes that involve dynamic climbing are referred to as “dyno”.
<b>Static climbing</b>: Static climbing is when you reach out to the next hold without jumping or using momentum. Technical approaches and strength help to climb more static. 
<b>Overhang</b>: Overhang walls extend over the ground. That means they are harder to climb because in addition to the normal force pulling you down, you have to keep yourself (especially your feet) close to the wall.
<b>Hook</b>: Hooks are climbing strategies where you use your foot to prevent your body from moving away from the wall and to give it additional support and stability. Toe hooks are hooks where you use the front part of your shoe to latch behind a hold. Heel hooks are hooks where you latch the back part of your shoe behind or on top of a hold. 
<b>Beta</b>: When you can’t figure out how to climb a route or a move you can ask someone for a beta. Someone gives you a beta when they show you how to climb a route — instructions or a briefing how to climb a route. Giving someone a beta without them asking is not nice — it destroys their mental climbing challenge. Also keep in mind that beta that someone is giving you might not be the perfect way to ascend a route for you! You might have different strengths and weaknesses.";;;
;Route Difficulties;difficulties;Many bouldering gyms use the Vermin-grading system to grade the difficulty of their routes. Here’s an overview of how that translates to other grading techniques. Different gyms might have slightly different understandings of difficulties and have their own styles for setting routes. Some gyms might also use color codes or the color of the holds as they difficulty indicator.;;"VB — Beginner Routes
V0 — Font. 4 to 4+
V1 — Font. 5

;Climbing Rules;climbing-rules;There are some rules that define how a route should be climbed to comply with “official climbing laws”. Or, you can be an outlaw and climb rainbow-routes.;;"Every route has a start and a top. Start with your hands at the start holds and put your feet on bottom holds, against the wall, or on a volume. They are not allowed to touch the ground. Some routes have a “run-in” start. This means that you dynamically jump into the route. There should be a little hint at the start of the route that tells you if this is a run-in.
Ask your gym how they mark the routes. Different gyms use different ways to show the start and the top of each route, as well as the difficulty.
When climbing a route you should only use holds of one color — that’s how the route was defined. Also your feet should only touch holds of this color. In most cases you are allowed to use the wall, edges and volumes as well — unless a note at the start of the route prohibits it.";;;
;Equipment;climbing-gear;Equipment is important. But to try bouldering for the first time you don’t need anything. Most gyms provide the essential tools. ;Shoes, Chalk, rent at gym at first but get your own;"The most important equipment (aside from your mental and physical energy) are shoes — they provide grip and stability for your feet. 
Shoes for bouldering have to be really tight — and if you rent them from the gym they might not fit perfectly. But that’s alright for the beginning. 
Chalk is also pretty important to improve the grip for your hands and fingers — it soaks up any sweat and prevents slipping of the holds. 
Most gyms provide brushes so you can clean the holds from dust and chalk.
That’s it. There’s not much to worry about equipment when it comes to bouldering. Of course, when you improve you want to invest in better shoes and maybe pants to improve your stability while climbing and to prevent scratches and injuries. ";;;
;Let’s Talk about Shoes;shoe-myths;Many people think that climbing shoes need to be too small. But that’s not true. At least not long-term. ;Fit, a little bit too small they extend and fit your feet perfectly. Dont wear socks. ;"Your boulder shoes should fit perfectly. There shouldn’t be any air between your toes and the shoe or behind your heels. This ensures that you gave the best grip while you climb.
Most shoes won’t find that perfect. So what can you do? How can you find these perfectly fitting shoes for you feet? The secret is: you have to buy them a little bit too small. This won’t be great for the beginning because your feet and toes might hurt. But don’t worry. The trick is that the gummy of your shoes will extend — until they fit your feet perfectly, like they have been built for your feet. At this point they won’t hurt anymore and you will have a great climbing performance. 
There are different shoes for beginners and professionals, for climbers and for boulderers. Try different ones and find the shoes that fit your need!
Finally, don’t wear socks in your climbing shoes — socks just add an additional layer of uncertainty and potential slipperiness. In addition you’ll get a better feeling for the rock without socks. ";;;
;How to approach a route;approach-a-route;There are a few things that you should consider before approaching the route. This helps you to be more safe, perform better and look more professional.;: Find the beginning, top, brush, sometimes handles are hard to see from chalk and shoes. Take a moment and get an overview of the route before starting your ascent. Where do I want to go? Which handles can I use? Is the difficulty ok? Is someone else climbing nearby that could be dangerous?;"Approaching a new route is always exciting. Each route has their own little secrets and novelties. But all routes have one thing in common: They have start holds and a top. Find those. Where does the route start? Where does it end? Is the difficulty of the route appropriate for your skills?
Some holds might not be obvious at a first glance — they might be covered in dust and chalk. It makes sense to use a brush to clean them first before climbing. 
Take a moment and get an overview of all holds. Take a look around the corner — maybe there is another hold that you haven’t recognized so far. Think about how you can utilize volumes and the wall.
Look out for other climbers and routes that might cross your route.
Now the fun begins. Figure out how to start the route. Where to place your feet. How to grab the start holds. Have fun!";;;
;Tips for new climbers;beginners-tips;Here are a few things that beginners often do wrong. Being aware of those will help you to climb better and longer, be safe and have more fun.;no long arms, just walk to a route without knowing the difficulty, don’t look at the route path, jump down, not using volumes, the wall is your friend;"A very common mistake of beginners is to <b>just walk to any route and start climbing</b>. Without knowing the difficulty and without knowing the path of the route. Step back and take some time: Which route does look interesting? Is the difficulty appropriate? Where does it start? Where does it end?
<b>Make sure your arms are stretched</b>. Don’t pull your body against the wall. Stretched arms are much more efficient and help you to climb longer (endurance). 
<b>Jumping down from the top</b> can be fun and rewarding. But in the long term this will hurt you knees. Climb down when possible. This prevents collisions with fellow climbers as well.
Remember: you are allowed to use volumes and the wall itself. The wall is your friend. ";;;

Warming Up;;;;;;145, 196, 227, ;;
;Why warming up;why-warming-up;Warming up is important to prevent injuries and to reach peak performance.;reach peak performance & prevent injuries;"Without warming up your body might not be ready for the extreme stress.

You’ll find some ideas for warming up in this section.";;;
;Warm Up techniques;warm-up-techniques;Here are some ideas how to warm your muscles and body up.;;"<b>Pulse raising</b>: Do a short jog or some skipping to get your heart pumping. As an alternative, consider to walk or cycle to the climbing gym.
<b>Stretching</b>: Gently move essential climbing muscles with a focus on your upper body. The goal is to loosen the muscles and lubricate the joints, you aren’t trying to increase your flexibility of motion here. Consider your fingers, wrists, elbows, shoulders, neck, back, legs, hips, and ankles.
<b>Start climbing</b>: Start by tackling some very easy problems or traversing on big holds, focusing on moving smoothly and efficiently. Climbing routes up and down again gets essential muscles warmed up. Then, gradually increase the difficulty. Dont forget to take rest between the problems.";;;

You can see that their climbing performance quickly decreases and does not reach their actual potential.
This example shows how to do it better. Start slowly, warm up and then increase the difficulty of the routes slowly. You will notice that you will be able to climb much longer and to keep your climbing performance high for most of the time. Of course, in the end you’ll run out of energy as well — but that’s the purpose of bouldering, right?";;;
Balance;;;;;;45, 106, 142, ;;
;Why balance matters;balance;Balance is the glue that binds all the other aspects of climbing technique together.;important for becoming a better climber;In climbing terms balance can be defined as the relationship between a climber’s centre of gravity and their base of support. Your centre of gravity is the theoretical point where the entire mass of your body is concentrated, it’s usually just above the belly button. The base of support is the area created by connecting your points of contact (your current hand and foot holds).;;;
;How to approach balance routes;balance-routes-approach;Routes with a focus on balance don’t require much strength. Here are some tips how you can manage them. ;No strength required;"You should aim to climb in a slow controlled style. While you reach between holds your body should stay reasonably still.
There are plenty of situation in bouldering when jumping for the next hold is the right option but if you find your body swinging uncontrollably every thing you move your hands then you need to pay more attention to body positioning and balance.";;;
;Train with a slack line;slack-line;Slack lines are a powerful way to improve your balance and ability to climb balance routes.;;"Many climbing gyms have a slack line somewhere. They are not only great to train balance, but are also a fun and meditational activity for breaks.
Becoming better at slacklining means you’ll be a better climber.";;http://amzn.to/2mGtaGs;
Fingers;;;;;;246, 191, 96, ;;
;Hand and finger strength;hand-finger;Finger strength is arguably one of the most important qualities of great climbers.;;The strength in your hand and your fingers determines how much force you can put into holding a hold. Having strong fingers means you can hold smaller and impractical holds as well.;;;
;Dos and don’ts;dont-hurt-fingers;While training finger strength is important, you should prevent damage.;dont hurt your fingers;You should not pout too much stress into your fingers – if you do it wrongly, you’ll hurt your fingers in long-term. While the finger positioning on the left might give you better hold, it is ergonomically bad for your finger joints. Instead, try to grab holds like shown in the right picture.;;;
;How to train finger strength;traing-finger-strength;In addition to use specific finger exercisers, there are many ways you can train your fingers as well.;;"The fingertip push-up is a classic exercise that can take your hand strength to new heights.
Pull-ups are another way to improve finger strength. Pull-ups can do a lot for your grip on their own, but if you want to give your hands some extra attention, try doing additional dead hangs after your pull-ups. When you’re strong enough, you can practice single-arm hangs as well. With any type of dead hang exercise, make sure to stay engaged through your shoulder blades. Don’t allow your chin to collapse into your chest.";;;
;Hangboard;hangboard;Stronger fingers mean you can use smaller holds, and holds that felt unhangable before will feel more manageable.;;"Hangboards are great to train the finger strength that you need for everyday climbing. There are great options on the market (also with app) that motivate you to keep going. 
Hanging there can be tough – start with easy hangs and short periods. You’ll see that your strength will increase quickly along with your climbing capabilities.";;;

Technique;;;;;;48, 118, 181, ;;
;It’s not all about strength;not-strength;Bouldering is often incorrectly seen as an activity that requires great muscles and strength. And while you can never be too strong, it’s your bouldering technique that will determine how good a climber you can become. To establish good habits try and focus on technique from the very start of your bouldering career.;its not about strength: technique is more important;;;;
;Think before you climb;thinking;Start a problem by trying to figure out how to ascend it. Make yourself a plan and decide what hand and foot holds you want to use and in what order – and which body positions seem optimal to solve the problem. ;;"When you have the plan, start your ascent.
If something doesn’t work out as you planned then you shouldn’t be afraid to improvise.
Once you are back on the ground, you should review your ascent. What worked out? Were you able to follow your plan directly? Is there any refinements you could make? Was there anything that didn’t feel reasonable and could be improved?
Bouldering is a continuous loop of planning, climbing and reviewing.";;;
;Techniques to save energy;save-energy;Bouldering is often incorrectly seen as an activity that requires great muscles and strength. And while you can never be too strong, it’s your bouldering technique that will determine how good a climber you can become. Here are some tips to save energy and climb longer.;Long arms to save energy;"Stretching out your arms is definitely the best way to save energy — instead of pulling your body close to the wall, relax and hang on your long, stretched arms.
Use your legs to push yourself upwards instead of pulling with your arms. The muscles in your legs are so much stronger and are experts in carrying your body weight. Your arms not so much. Hooks can help to distribute your body weight to your legs.";;;
;Haning technique;hanging;Hanging techniques make sure that your body weight is distributed in a way that you get more grip on the holds.;sHang sideways;"Hang sideways in the direction the hold is facing to get more grip.
Sometimes you need to change sides in order to get into the best position.";;;
;Toe Hook and Heel Hook;hooks;Hooks are powerful mechanisms to stabilize your body on the wall.;;"<b>Heel Hook</b>: Use a heel hook (sometimes just referred to as “hook”) to support your arms for upward movements. Shifting some weight on your hook takes weight from your arms and gives you more flexibility to pull yourself upwards.
<b>Toe Hook</b>: Toe hooks are mostly used to keep your body close to the wall and to prevent swinging out. Put the tip of your shoe behind a hold or volume to evoke these effects.";;;
;Pushing;push;Pushing yourself upwards from holds first feels strange — but once you learn how to use this strategy you will love it.;;When you reach a point where you can stand up and have a good hold next to or below you, you can use your hand to push yourself upwards.

Fear;;;;;;250, 97, 77, ;;
;Fear and Bouldering;fear;Fear warns you of dangerous moves. But sometimes your fear is just preventing you from finishing a route. Will your shoe provide enough grip on this volume? Will your hand slip off the hold and you fall down?;fear warns you of dangerous things. But with the right training, some things aren’t that dangerous anymore. But your brain still thinks they are. This is why you sometimes need to overcome mental boundaries to send a route. ;"Whenever you feel unsafe you should make sure that falling down in this moment won’t hurt you. Be prepared to fall down.

;Use techniques instead of strength;use-techniques;There are plenty of techniques that help you to make bouldering easier – with a focus of requiring less strength.;Long arms, lean into handle, toe hooks, heel hooks;"<b>Stretched arms</b>: Stretching out your arms is definitely the best way to save energy — instead of pulling your body close to the wall, relax and hang on your long, stretched arms.
<b>Use your feet</b>: Use your legs to push yourself upwards instead of pulling with your arms. The muscles in your legs are so much stronger and are experts in carrying your body weight. Your arms not so much. Hooks can help to distribute your body weight to your legs.
<b>Hang sideways</b>: Hang sideways in the direction the hold is facing to get more grip.
Sometimes you need to change sides in order to get into the best position.
<b>Heel Hook</b>: Use a heel hook (sometimes just referred to as “hook”) to support your arms for upward movements. Shifting some weight on your hook takes weight from your arms and gives you more flexibility to pull yourself upwards.
<b>Toe Hook</b>: Toe hooks are mostly used to keep your body close to the wall and to prevent swinging out. Put the tip of your shoe behind a hold or volume to evoke these effects.";;;
;Diagram of performance;peak-performance;The diagram of performance shows you why it is important to warm up and then slowly increase difficulty of routes. ;;"The first example shows a performance-diagram of a climber that immediately starts to tackle difficult routes. You can see that their climbing performance quickly decreases and that they don't reach their actual climbing potential for that day.
This example shows how to do it better. Start slowly, warm up and then increase the difficulty of the routes slowly. You will notice that you will be able to climb much longer – on top of that you are also able to climb much harder routes. Of course, in the end you’ll run out of energy as well at some point — but that’s the purpose of bouldering, right?";;;
