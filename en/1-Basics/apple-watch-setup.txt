Apple Watch Advanced Settings
To be able to see the latest stats and metrics on your watch while climbing, you should make sure that iRedpoint stays in the foreground during your workout sessions.
Open the "Settings" app on your Apple Watch.
Scroll down and go to â€œGeneral".
Select "Wake Screen" to show all available wake screen options.
Under "On Screen Raise Show Last App" find "While in Session". This allows you to see the latest statistics while in a climbing workout session. Otherwise, the watch could return to the watch face after a while.
