How to approach a route
There are a few things that you should consider before approaching the route. This helps you to be more safe, perform better and look more professional.
Approaching a new route is always exciting. Each route has their own little secrets and novelties. But all routes have one thing in common: They have start holds and a top. Find those. Where does the route start? Where does it end? Is the difficulty of the route appropriate for your skills?
Some holds might not be obvious at a first glance — they might be covered in dust and chalk. It makes sense to use a brush to clean them first before climbing. 
Take a moment and get an overview of all holds. Take a look around the corner — maybe there is another hold that you haven’t recognized so far. Think about how you can utilize volumes and the wall.
Look out for other climbers and routes that might cross your route.
Now the fun begins. Figure out how to start the route. Where to place your feet. How to grab the start holds. Have fun!
