Tips for new climbers
Here are a few things that beginners often do wrong. Being aware of those will help you to climb better and longer, be safe and have more fun.
A very common mistake of beginners is to <b>just walk to any route and start climbing</b>. Without knowing the difficulty and without knowing the path of the route. Step back and take some time: Which route does look interesting? Is the difficulty appropriate? Where does it start? Where does it end?
<b>Make sure your arms are stretched</b>. Donâ€™t pull your body against the wall. Stretched arms are much more efficient and help you to climb longer (endurance). 
<b>Jumping down from the top</b> can be fun and rewarding. But in the long term this will hurt you knees. Climb down when possible. This prevents collisions with fellow climbers as well.
Remember: you are allowed to use volumes and the wall itself. The wall is your friend.
