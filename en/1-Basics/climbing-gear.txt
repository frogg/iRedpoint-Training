Equipment
Equipment is important. But to try bouldering for the first time you don’t need anything. Most gyms provide the essential tools. 
The most important equipment (aside from your mental and physical energy) are shoes — they provide grip and stability for your feet. 
Shoes for bouldering have to be really tight — and if you rent them from the gym they might not fit perfectly. But that’s alright for the beginning. 
Chalk is also pretty important to improve the grip for your hands and fingers — it soaks up any sweat and prevents slipping of the holds. 
Most gyms provide brushes so you can clean the holds from dust and chalk.
That’s it. There’s not much to worry about equipment when it comes to bouldering. Of course, when you improve you want to invest in better shoes and maybe pants to improve your stability while climbing and to prevent scratches and injuries.
