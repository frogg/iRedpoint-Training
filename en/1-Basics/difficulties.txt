Route Difficulties
Many bouldering gyms use the Vermin-grading system to grade the difficulty of their routes. Here’s an overview of how that translates to other grading techniques. Different gyms might have slightly different understandings of difficulties and have their own styles for setting routes. Some gyms might also use color codes or the color of the holds as they difficulty indicator.
