Important Terms
Here is some important climbing terminology that will help you speak to fellow climbers at the gym about your recent ascents.
<b>Route</b>: A route is one defined ascent on a wall. Usually it consists of holds of one color. It has a start and a top. Each route requires different strength and can have different difficulties. While it defines which holds to use it does usually not define how to climb the route. There are always multiple approaches! Find the one that works best for you.
<b>Difficulty</b>: The difficulty of a route is used to compare and measure your climbing skills. When you come to a new gym and know your bouldering grade you immediately know which routes are easy and which ones are hard for you to climb. Different gyms use different codes to indicate difficulty. Many use a V-Scale (V0, V1, V2, …) others have color-coded holds. Ask in your gym which method they use!
<b>Chalk</b>: Chalk is the white powered that climbers put not heir hands to have better grip. It absorbs sweat from the skin and makes holds less slippery. Chalk is usually stored in so-called chalk-bags. Chalk is actually not the same chalk you know from school but rather magnesia (oxidized magnesium).
<b>Hold</b>: A hold is one hold in a route. It is usually colored and exists in plenty different forms and sizes.
<b>Volume</b>: Volumes are larger attachments to the wall that have the same surface like the wall. You can use them for every route. They are usually a good option for your feed.
<b>Send</b>: Send is the verb that you use when you successfully finished a route. You then say: “I sent the yellow route!”.
<b>Flash</b>: Flashing a route is something special. You say this when you send the route first try. Like a hole-in-one! “I flashed the blue route over there!”.
<b>Dynamic Climbing</b>: Dynamic climbing is the opposite of static climbing. It means that you reach to the next hold using a lot of momentum or even jump to it. This is why dynamic movements involve more risk but they are also fun! Some routes that involve dynamic climbing are referred to as “dyno”.
<b>Static climbing</b>: Static climbing is when you reach out to the next hold without jumping or using momentum. Technical approaches and strength help to climb more static. 
<b>Overhang</b>: Overhang walls extend over the ground. That means they are harder to climb because in addition to the normal force pulling you down, you have to keep yourself (especially your feet) close to the wall.
<b>Hook</b>: Hooks are climbing strategies where you use your foot to prevent your body from moving away from the wall and to give it additional support and stability. Toe hooks are hooks where you use the front part of your shoe to latch behind a hold. Heel hooks are hooks where you latch the back part of your shoe behind or on top of a hold. 
<b>Beta</b>: When you can’t figure out how to climb a route or a move you can ask someone for a beta. Someone gives you a beta when they show you how to climb a route — instructions or a briefing how to climb a route. Giving someone a beta without them asking is not nice — it destroys their mental climbing challenge. Also keep in mind that beta that someone is giving you might not be the perfect way to ascend a route for you! You might have different strengths and weaknesses.
