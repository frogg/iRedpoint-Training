Safety Rules
It is important to understand the rules of your local climbing gym before you climb there. In addition to that, here are a few â€œcommon sense" rules that will help you prevent dangerous situations.
Always pay attention to fellow climbers when walking around in the gym. Falling off the wall is an inherent part of bouldering. Walking, standing and sitting in the falling zone should be avoided.
Be considerate of other climbers; please no running or yelling.
Many boulder routes are overlapping which may lead to collisions. Make sure that your boulder is completely free before starting. 
Climbing is even more enjoyable if you are acting considerately. Try to be as friendly towards others as you would expect them to be!
