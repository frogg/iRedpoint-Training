What is Bouldering?
Bouldering is a form of rock climbing that is performed on small rock formations or artificial rock walls, known as boulders, without the use of ropes or harnesses. It is a highly addictive sport that challenges your brain, and can improve your health!
Bouldering is very different from normal climbing: There is no harness and no rope to prevent you from falling, only a pad on the ground absorbs falling people — and that’s fine because routes are much shorter: normally between 3 and 4.5 meters. On the other hand, routes are also much more difficult: think of it as condensed problems that you want to solve, whereas climbing is more about endurance. 
In both cases, when you reach the top you will feel a rush of pride, positivity and euphoria — and that’s what makes you feel great and probably is one reason why this sport is so popular and addictive. The best way to get started and get familiar with bouldering is simply to do it.
