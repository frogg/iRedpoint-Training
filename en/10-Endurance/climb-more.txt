Climb more
You won’t believe it but this is actually the best trick to get better at climbing: climb more.
This is actually iRedpoint’s best advice: climb more often. Go every other day. Whenever you have time. Bouldering is addictive. It’s a healthy addiction.
Find a climbing group that goes frequently to the climbing gym. Twice or three times a week is great — if you can, try to go every other day!
