Diagram of performance
The diagram of performance shows you why it is important to warm up and then slowly increase difficulty of routes. 
The first example shows a performance-diagram of a climber that immediately starts to tackle difficult routes. You can see that their climbing performance quickly decreases and that they don't reach their actual climbing potential for that day.
This example shows how to do it better. Start slowly, warm up and then increase the difficulty of the routes slowly. You will notice that you will be able to climb much longer – on top of that you are also able to climb much harder routes. Of course, in the end you’ll run out of energy as well at some point — but that’s the purpose of bouldering, right?
