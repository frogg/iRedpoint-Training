Use techniques instead of strength
There are plenty of techniques that help you to make bouldering easier – with a focus of requiring less strength.
<b>Stretched arms</b>: Stretching out your arms is definitely the best way to save energy — instead of pulling your body close to the wall, relax and hang on your long, stretched arms.
<b>Use your feet</b>: Use your legs to push yourself upwards instead of pulling with your arms. The muscles in your legs are so much stronger and are experts in carrying your body weight. Your arms not so much. Hooks can help to distribute your body weight to your legs.
<b>Hang sideways</b>: Hang sideways in the direction the hold is facing to get more grip.
Sometimes you need to change sides in order to get into the best position.
<b>Heel Hook</b>: Use a heel hook (sometimes just referred to as “hook”) to support your arms for upward movements. Shifting some weight on your hook takes weight from your arms and gives you more flexibility to pull yourself upwards.
<b>Toe Hook</b>: Toe hooks are mostly used to keep your body close to the wall and to prevent swinging out. Put the tip of your shoe behind a hold or volume to evoke these effects.
