Shoes
Here are some tips that you should consider when buying shoes for bouldering. Buying better shoes specifically meant for climbing can increase your climbing performance significantly.
Your boulder shoes should fit perfectly. There shouldn’t be any air between your toes and the shoe or behind your heels. This ensures that you gave the best grip while you climb.
Most shoes won’t find that perfect. So what can you do? How can you find these perfectly fitting shoes for you feet? The secret is: you have to buy them a little bit too small. This won’t be great for the beginning because your feet and toes might hurt. But don’t worry. The trick is that the gummy of your shoes will extend — until they fit your feet perfectly, like they have been built for your feet. At this point they won’t hurt anymore and you will have a great climbing performance. 
There are different shoes for beginners and professionals, for climbers and for boulderers. Try different ones and find the shoes that fit your need!
Finally, don’t wear socks in your climbing shoes — socks just add an additional layer of uncertainty and potential slipperiness. In addition you’ll get a better feeling for the rock without socks.
