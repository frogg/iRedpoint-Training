Tape
There are two main reasons to use tape in climbing: skin protection and structural support.
When you ripped off some skin from your finger you can use tape to protect the wound beneath it. Make sure that it feels comfortable before you start climbing again.
If it doesn’t work out don’t worry. Stop climbing for the day and use some skin care to help your kin to recover. So you’re ready for your next ascents!
