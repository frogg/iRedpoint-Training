How to approach balance routes
Routes with a focus on balance donâ€™t require much strength. Here are some tips how you can manage them. 
You should aim to climb in a slow controlled style. While you reach between holds your body should stay reasonably still.
There are plenty of situation in bouldering when jumping for the next hold is the right option but if you find your body swinging uncontrollably every thing you move your hands then you need to pay more attention to body positioning and balance.
