Why balance matters
Balance is the glue that binds all the other aspects of climbing technique together.
In climbing terms balance can be defined as the relationship between a climber’s centre of gravity and their base of support. Your centre of gravity is the theoretical point where the entire mass of your body is concentrated, it’s usually just above the belly button. The base of support is the area created by connecting your points of contact (your current hand and foot holds).
