Train with a slack line
Slack lines are a powerful way to improve your balance and ability to climb balance routes.
Many climbing gyms have a slack line somewhere. They are not only great to train balance, but are also a fun and meditational activity for breaks.
Becoming better at slacklining means youâ€™ll be a better climber.
