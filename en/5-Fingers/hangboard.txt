Hangboard
Stronger fingers mean you can use smaller holds, and holds that felt unhangable before will feel more manageable.
Hangboards are great to train the finger strength that you need for everyday climbing. There are great options on the market (also with app) that motivate you to keep going. 
Hanging there can be tough – start with easy hangs and short periods. You’ll see that your strength will increase quickly along with your climbing capabilities.
