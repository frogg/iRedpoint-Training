How to train finger strength
In addition to use specific finger exercisers, there are many ways you can train your fingers as well.
The fingertip push-up is a classic exercise that can take your hand strength to new heights.
Pull-ups are another way to improve finger strength. Pull-ups can do a lot for your grip on their own, but if you want to give your hands some extra attention, try doing additional dead hangs after your pull-ups. When you’re strong enough, you can practice single-arm hangs as well. With any type of dead hang exercise, make sure to stay engaged through your shoulder blades. Don’t allow your chin to collapse into your chest.
