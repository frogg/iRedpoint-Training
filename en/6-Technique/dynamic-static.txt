Dynamic and Static bouldering
Static and dynamic bouldering are both fun and require different strengths. 
<b>Dynamic Climbing</b>: Dynamic climbing is the opposite of static climbing. It means that you reach to the next hold using a lot of momentum or even jump to it. This is why dynamic movements involve more risk but they are also fun! Some routes that involve dynamic climbing are referred to as “dyno”.
<b>Static climbing</b>: Static climbing is when you reach out to the next hold without jumping or using momentum. Technical approaches and strength help to climb more static.
