Toe Hook and Heel Hook
Hooks are powerful mechanisms to stabilize your body on the wall.
<b>Heel Hook</b>: Use a heel hook (sometimes just referred to as “hook”) to support your arms for upward movements. Shifting some weight on your hook takes weight from your arms and gives you more flexibility to pull yourself upwards.
<b>Toe Hook</b>: Toe hooks are mostly used to keep your body close to the wall and to prevent swinging out. Put the tip of your shoe behind a hold or volume to evoke these effects.
