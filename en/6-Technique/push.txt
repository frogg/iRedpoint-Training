Pushing
Pushing yourself upwards from holds first feels strange â€” but once you learn how to use this strategy you will love it.
When you reach a point where you can stand up and have a good hold next to or below you, you can use your hand to push yourself upwards. This is helpful in situations where large gaps between hand-holds require you to reach further.
