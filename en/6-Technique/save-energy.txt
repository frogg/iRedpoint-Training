Techniques to save energy
Bouldering is often incorrectly seen as an activity that requires great muscles and strength. And while you can never be too strong, it’s your bouldering technique that will determine how good a climber you can become. Here are some tips to save energy and climb longer.
Stretching out your arms is definitely the best way to save energy — instead of pulling your body close to the wall, relax and hang on your long, stretched arms.
Use your legs to push yourself upwards instead of pulling with your arms. The muscles in your legs are so much stronger and are experts in carrying your body weight. Your arms not so much. Hooks can help to distribute your body weight to your legs.
