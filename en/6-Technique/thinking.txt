Think before you climb
Start a problem by trying to figure out how to ascend it. Make yourself a plan and decide what hand and foot holds you want to use and in what order – and which body positions seem optimal to solve the problem. 
When you have the plan, start your ascent.
If something doesn’t work out as you planned then you shouldn’t be afraid to improvise.
Once you are back on the ground, you should review your ascent. What worked out? Were you able to follow your plan directly? Is there any refinements you could make? Was there anything that didn’t feel reasonable and could be improved?
Bouldering is a continuous loop of planning, climbing and reviewing.
