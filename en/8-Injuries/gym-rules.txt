Gym rules
Common sense is a good start to respect your local gym rules. But some gyms have special rules that you should be familiar with. 
When you come to a new gym for the first time you should review the rules in order to see if there is anything unexpected. 
Besides that, be cautious and follow the rules and most importantly: have fun!
