Skin healing
The skin on your palms is heavily used and stressed during climbing. Give your skin some care to make sure it recovers quickly and gets stronger.
Donâ€™t forget to wash your hands right after climbing. This washes away all the dirt and chalk rests.
Then, apply some hand care to help your skin recover and come back to its strength quickly.
