Have Breaks and Rest-Days
Having breaks is an essential part of climbing and bouldering. Climbing routes stresses certain muscles extremely and they deserve breaks so they can recover and give you full strength for your next climb!
Breaks of 5 to 10 minutes between routes are not a bad idea. They actually help your muscles and fingers to recover to be ready for the next ascent.
Climbing on two consecutive days might not be the best idea – your body needs some rest. There is other fun things to do (ok, thats arguably 😝).
