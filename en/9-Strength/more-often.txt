Climb more often
One of the best tricks to get stronger is to climb more! I know, that’s probably not what you expected but it is actually true. 
This is actually iRedpoint’s best advice: climb more often. Go every other day. Whenever you have time. Bouldering is addictive. It’s a healthy addiction.
Find a climbing group that goes frequently. Climbing twice or three times a week helps you to improve significantly.
