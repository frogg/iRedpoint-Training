Pull ups
Muscle strength in your arm is not everything when it comes to climbing – but you can never be strong enough. 
Doing a quick pull-up/workout session after climbing helps you to build up stronger arm muscles which in return helps you to climb more difficult routes. Keep in mind that pure muscle strength won’t help you to become a better climber.
